# Side-Scrolling-Container-Template

A simple template for a side-scrolling container with a decoding form.

## Concept
This template is designed to provide a container that scrolls from the right to the left of the screen with a decoding form. It's built using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and jQuery.

## Getting Started
To get started, simply download the code from this repository or copy the HTML, CSS, and jQuery code into your own files.

## Usage
The template consists of two main parts:

- A hidden container that will slide in from the right when a button is clicked.
- A block of text that will serve as the content of the page.

The container can be revealed by clicking on a button with the letter "D" on it. The container will slide into view, revealing a form with a text area and a "Decode" button. The container can be hidden again by clicking on the same button.

The block of text can be modified as desired to create the desired content for the page.

To use the template, simply modify the HTML and CSS code as necessary to fit your needs. You can also modify the jQuery code to change the behavior of the container or to add additional functionality.
